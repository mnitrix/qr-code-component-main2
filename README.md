## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to make a layout using the flexbox property in CSS. I learned how to add semantics to the webpage using HTML and lots of other different things while
making this webpage.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
 
### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs]([https://www.example.com](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)) - This helped me in learning CSS. I usually use this resource for 
   learning different types of CSS properties.
- [W3Schools]([https://www.example.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)) - This is also an amazing site for learning. This site helped me in writing HTML codes.
